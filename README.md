# About-me
## I built a website called Salmon Cookies . Generates random numbers of customers and cookies sold. Then it displays the cookies sold per hour and at the end shows a total amount of cookies sold for each store.It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

# Reflections and Comments
- The hardest part of this was probably setting up the javascript and making each store display their totals and per hour numbers.
- used javascript to make sure the stores displayed their totals differently as well as when it is refreshed show random numbers.
